    <!-- universal selector:selects all elements within the page.Example below -->
    <div class="universal selector"> 
    <p>This is a paragraph with universal selector styles.</p>
    <span>This is a span with universal selector styles.</span>

    </div>

    <!--Type/Element Selector:This selector will select a given element.E.g Below  -->
    <p>This is a paragraph with type selector styles</p>
    <div>This is a div with type selector styles</div>

    <!-- class selector:will select all elements with the given class.
    A class is an attribute you place on a html element.E.g Below -->
    <div class="highlight">This div has highlight class </div>
    <p>This paragraph also has highlight class</p>

    <!-- id selector:are similar with the given ID which is another attribute you place on an html element
    The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID.
It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:E.g Below -->
<div id="myld"> This Div has an ID of "myID".</div>
    <!--Attribute Selector:Selects elements with a specific attribute and value.  -->
    <!-- Descendant Selector selects all the elements that are descendants  -->
    <article>
    <p>This paragraph is inside an article</p>
    </article>
    <!-- child selector:Selects all direct children of a specified element  -->
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>

    </ul>
